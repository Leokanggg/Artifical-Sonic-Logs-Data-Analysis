# Artifical-Sonic-Logs-Data-Analysis
Basic Challenge: "The challenge will be a regression exercise to generate artificial sonic logs perfectly from the least number of available logs" 

#Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to benchmark and discover new approaches that may lead to a class of more reliable production forecasts than traditional
approaches such as Arps, modified hyperbolic, Duong and logistic DCA models.
